# üöó Car Management Web Application (Laravel)

This project is a **web application built with Laravel**, designed to allow users to manage their favorite cars.  
The system distinguishes between two roles: **user** and **administrator (admin)**.  
Users can register, log in, manage their favorite cars, upload pictures, and request new car brands.  
Administrators can manage users (CRUD), approve deletion requests, unlock locked accounts, and expand the car brand database.  
The application has been built with security in mind (password hashing with salt, CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yurij90/pgy-cars.git
cd pgy-cars
./setup.sh
```
